# GitHub Pull Request Opt In Strategy Plugin

This branch build strategy will only automatically build pull requests with a configurable label.

This allows maintainers greater control over which pull requests are built and to prioritize the most important pull requests.

Projects are built automatically when the pull request is scanned and the required label is present, or manually through the Jenkins UI.
